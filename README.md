# A Tree Notetaker

In university, I preferred taking notes point-form.  I always got frustrated by the lack of arbitrarily deeply nested bullet points with existing solutions.  I whipped this together to solve a pain point in my own style of learning.  

Maybe you might find it helpful to you too!

## How to use:

Navigate the tree by using `ctrl` + `j`, `k`, `l` and `;`.  You might notice this Vim's arrow keys shifted over to fit neatly in your right homerow.  You're also free to use the arrow keys if you prefer.

Delete a node using `ctrl` + `x`, `del` or `enter`.  <em> Note: </em> Deleting a node will delete all of it's children.
